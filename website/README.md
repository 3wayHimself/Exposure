# Exposure Website

## [PayWithExposure.com](https://paywithexposure.com)

This website is based on the [Start Bootstrap - Agency template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/). We're not huge fans of building sites this way, but when you're doing things purely for the Exposure, it gets a bit messy.

Feel free to contribute PRs. We may even throw some Exposure your way.

### Running

- Clone the repo
- Run `yarn`
- Run `yarn start`.
- The site should now be available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Building

- Clone the repo
- Run `yarn`
- Run `yarn build`.
- The built files are now in the same directory. Yeah, we know. Because gulp.
